This is a work-in-progress set of cheat sheets on basic Javascript concepts,
prepared primarily with a friend in mind. The goal is to help people quickly
identify the basic patterns, and be lead through some insights that I think they
may miss. Also, I employ a narrative programming style where each code example
provides a story with the code.

* concept: - computer operations with 'statements' that load/store, compare, transform. Naming and grouping things for convenience. High level of map of concepts to keywords. Humans have evolved common approaches to solving problems like maintaining a list, grouping items together, relating things together.
* basic statement syntax - single, literal, blocks, identifying statements by recognizing key indicators (), [], command, {} and mathematical operators.
* operators (basic, examples of assignment to vars, math) 
* basic conditional - IF ... mention there are other forms
* basic functions - naming, declaration, passing and receiving 
* basic arrays - a named box with numbered slots
* basic objects - a named box that can hold other named boxes
* basic looping - using for ... mention there are other forms
* practical: history of language structures with for, unrolling the loop, convenience
* comparison: code blocks - in conditionals, loops, functions
* concept: scoping rules in javascript - var, let, const, this
* comparison: variables, arrays, objects
* concept: value vs reference
* concept: variables and literals, indirection
* summary of language concepts, discussion of learning built-in libraries, algorithms, environment, common practices and tools

* common environments for Javascript
* common standard built-in objects - Math, document, etc
* specialized libraries - npm
* environment features - loading/saving data to files. displaying data (graphics). getting user input (keyboard, mouse). network, process control, packagind and deploying apps, specialized I/O, controlling hardware.

* common approaches - converting type, detecting type errors, persisting data, modular programming, passing by value or reference, accessing code deined in other modules, error handling, fictions, queues, stacks, sets, enums, timers
* common algorithms - it's rare to write the basics these days, but here are examples of basics and where to find more
* common practices - making dev easier, working with other devs, working with non-devs, making dev easier for other devs, software architecture, API design, collaborative tools, testing, quality assurance
